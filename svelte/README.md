## Midi Visualizer

This is a simple svelte app to visualize the midi data, initially intended for keyboards to highlight pleasant vs unpleasant note transitions through the lens of the [Circle-of-fifths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths).


## Get started

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
